# Hi, I'm Álvaro 👋
## About Me
I develop FiveM scripts with a strong focus on **security**, **performance**, **structure**, and **long-term maintainability**.
I enjoy designing systems that solve real server needs, from gameplay mechanics to backend logic, always ensuring stable and secure implementations.
Constantly improving, learning, and refining my approach to clean, efficient, and reliable code.

## Work
I currently work on my own script store called **ALX Scripts**, where I design, develop, and maintain custom FiveM solutions with a professional and long-term mindset.

## Consulting & Support
I also help FiveM servers **solve scripting and security issues**, providing professional assistance for:

- Bug fixing and system refactors  
- Performance bottlenecks  
- Security vulnerabilities and exploit prevention  
- Script audits and improvements  

All consulting and support services are **paid**, focused on delivering reliable and long-term solutions.

## What I Focus On
- Secure and optimized FiveM scripting  
- Scalable and well-structured systems  
- Clean and maintainable codebases  
- Real-world server needs and solutions  
- Long-term support and stability
